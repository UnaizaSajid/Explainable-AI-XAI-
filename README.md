# Explainable-Artificial Intelligence -XAI

The goal of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is to improve the comprehension of AI systems. Modern machine learning technology, which is at the heart
of AI applications, is extremely opaque, unintuitive, and difficult for common users to understand. Finding the causes of failures, triumphs, and past mistakes 
to prevent and suggest corrective actions can be challenging for analysts. XAI solves this issue by creating models that are easier to understand while 
maintaining a high learning performance.
